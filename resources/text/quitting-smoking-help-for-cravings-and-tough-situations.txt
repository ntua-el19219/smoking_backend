Help for Cravings and Tough Situations While You're Quitting Tobacco







Quitting tobacco can be a long, hard process. You will likely have strong cravings. You will probably go through times when it’s especially hard to stay away from tobacco. But there are things you can do to help yourself stay quit.

How do I get through the rough spots after I quit?
When you quit, and whenever you’re having a rough time, try to avoid things that may trigger your cravings.
Create new habits and a tobacco-free environment around you.

Spend as much free time as you can in public places where tobacco products aren’t allowed. Libraries, stores, museums, theaters, restaurants without bars or patios, and churches are most often smoke-free.
Stay away from activities, people, and places you link with using tobacco.
Don’t drink alcohol, coffee, or any other drinks you link with using tobacco. Instead, try different types of water, sports drinks, or 100% fruit juices. Choose drinks that are low- or no-calorie.
Stay away from foods that trigger cravings to use tobacco. Sugary or spicy foods can be triggers.

Practice self-care to ease your stress and cravings.

Eat 4 to 6 small meals during the day. This keeps your blood sugar levels steady, your energy balanced, and helps prevent urges to smoke or chew.
Take extra care of yourself. Drink water, eat well, and get enough sleep. This might help you have the energy you need to handle extra stress.
Take deep breaths to relax. Picture your lungs filling with fresh, clean air.
Exercise in short bursts (try alternately tensing and relaxing your muscles, doing push-ups or lunges, walking up the stairs, or touching your toes).
Brush your teeth and enjoy that fresh taste.
Call a friend or family member, use a mobile app that connects you with others, or a telephone Quitline when you need extra help or support.

Replace habits from before you quit.

If you miss the feeling of having a cigarette in your hand, hold something else like a pencil, paper clip, coin, or marble.
If you miss the feeling of having something in your mouth, try toothpicks, cinnamon sticks, sugarless gum, sugar-free lollipops, or celery. Some people chew on a straw or stir stick.
Take deep breaths to relax. Picture your lungs filling with fresh, clean air.

Remember why you quit tobacco.

Remember your goal and the fact that the urge will lessen over time.
Think about how great it is that you’re getting healthier.
Remember that quitting is a learning process. Be patient with yourself.
Think of all the important reasons you decided to quit.
As a reminder, put a picture of the people who are most important to you somewhere you see it every day, or keep one handy on your phone.

Above all, reward yourself for doing your best. Give yourself rewards often if that’s what it takes to keep going. Plan to do something fun.
When you get cravings
Cravings are real. It’s not just your imagination. When you feel a strong urge to use tobacco, you may also notice that your mood changes. Your heart rate and blood pressure might go up, too.
Try these tips to get through it. Hang in there – the cravings will get better.
Keep distractions on hand.

Keep substitutes handy that you can suck or chew on, such as carrots, pickles, apples, celery, raisins, or sugar-free gum or hard candy.
Light incense or a candle instead of a cigarette.
Wear a rubber band around your wrist. When you think about smoking or chewing, snap it against your wrist to remind yourself of all the reasons you quit. Then remember that you won’t always need a rubber band to help you stay with your plans to quit.

Remind yourself it will get easier. 

Emotions like anger, frustration, anxiety, irritability, and even depression are normal after quitting. They will get better as you learn ways to cope that don’t involve tobacco. See your doctor if these feelings last for more than a month.
Tell yourself, “No.” Say it out loud. Practice doing this a few times and listen to yourself.

Practice positive self talk.

“I’m too strong to give in to cravings.”
“I don't use tobacco anymore.”
“I will not let my friends and family down.”
And most important, “I will not let myself down.”

Learn to relax quickly and deeply.

Go for a walk. Exercise can improve your mood and relieve stress.
Take a shower or bath.
Think about a calming, peaceful place, and imagine you are there. Get away from it all for a moment. Focus on that peaceful place and nothing else.

Other ways to stay active
You might have a lot of pent-up energy while trying to quit and stay tobacco-free. When you’re looking for something to do, think about ways you can be active and productive.

Do yardwork or housework.
Organize or clean out a closet, a room, or even the entire basement.
Get involved in a new sport or hobby.

Some of these distractions can help keep you from gaining weight after quitting, too.
Find activities that are cheap or free. You can find programs online or streaming through a TV or mobile app for beginner’s yoga, tai chi, or aerobics. You could also borrow a video or book about them from the library.
A walk in a park, on a trail, a local mall, or around your neighborhood are all good ways to get moving, too. You’ll notice over time that it gets easier to do these things. And watch how much better you can breathe as each day passes.
Staying tobacco-free over holidays
The first few weeks after quitting can be hard for anyone. And staying away from tobacco may be extra tough during a holiday season, when stress and the temptation to overindulge are often worse.
Some special efforts can help you celebrate the holidays without giving into the urge. Many of these ideas can also help throughout the year.
Celebrate being tobacco-free and try these tips to keep your mind off smoking:

Think about hosting holiday dinner. This will keep you busy. Shopping and cooking will take up a lot of your time. If you prefer being a guest, consider making a special dish to share.
Don’t overdo it. You might be inclined to go overboard with the holiday feasting. Be aware of how much you eat and drink; it may be easy to give into these other temptations. If you do overdo it, forgive yourself. Remember, next year it won’t be as hard.
Try to stay away from alcohol. Stick to sugar-free seltzer, punch without alcohol, club soda, or apple cider. This will curb the urge to light up when drinking and can also help keep off extra pounds.
Avoid spicy and sugary foods. Spicy and sugary foods tend to make people crave cigarettes more.
Nibble on low-calorie foods. Low-calorie foods like carrot sticks, apples, and other healthy snacks can satisfy your need for crunch without adding extra pounds.
Stretch out meals. Eat slowly and pause between bites to make a meal more satisfying. For dessert, grab a piece of fruit, or crack some nuts – something that will keep your hands busy, too.
Keep busy at parties. Serving snacks and meeting guests will help keep your mind off smoking. If the urge to smoke or chew presents itself, put something else in your hand.
Treat yourself to something special. Celebrate staying quit. Think about buying yourself something special you’ve been wanting.
Learn to cope with frustration. Any added frustration can leave you wanting a cigarette or a dip. Take along your favorite magazine or book, check your email, or text a friend while waiting in lines. When you feel you’re about to lose control, stop and think. Take hold of yourself and start talking with someone in line next to you, or start looking at what you brought with you.

If you have a weak moment and slip during the holidays, don’t panic.
Take a deep breath. Remind yourself of your commitment to quit and all the reasons you quit in the first place. Commit to going back to your quit program right away. Destroy any tobacco products you have before you’re tempted again. Try to figure out why you had a setback and learn from it.
More suggestions
Here are more ideas that have helped others kick their tobacco habit for good:

Take one day at a time. When you wake up each morning, make the promise you won’t smoke or chew that day. A day at a time keeps the whole thing more manageable.
Picture and plan for your success. Plan ahead and think of how you’ll deal with stressful situations with other alternatives.
Take a breather. Relaxation exercises can help relieve your urge to smoke or chew. Take a deep breath, hold it for a second, then release it very slowly. Or stand up and stretch while you take a few deep breaths. Remember, the urge is only temporary. It will pass.
Work out. Physical activity helps relieve tension and the urge to smoke or chew. Exercise will also help burn off any extra weight.
Make friends with people who don't smoke, chew or use tobacco products. They can be your partners to help keep you busy. Plan time together and explore new activities you might enjoy. Remember, you’re learning to be tobacco-free, and you need to find new places and activities to replace your old ones.

Get support you can count on
If you’re thinking about reaching for a cigarette or other tobacco product, reach for help instead. Ask your friends and family to encourage the new healthier you, reach out to a support group, visit Nicotine Anonymous, or call 1-800-QUIT NOW.
You can always call American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345. We want you to quit tobacco and we’re here to help you do it.













Dealing with the Mental Part of Tobacco Addiction
