Health Benefits of Quitting Smoking Over Time







It’s never too late to quit using tobacco. The sooner you quit, the more you can reduce your chances of getting cancer and other diseases.









                          On this page

Within minutes of smoking your last cigarette, your body begins to recover:
Are there other benefits of quitting that I’ll notice right away?










Within minutes of smoking your last cigarette, your body begins to recover:







A few minutes after quitting

Your heart rate drops.




24 hours to a few days after quitting

Nicotine levels in your blood drop to zero. The carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal.




1 to 12 months after quitting

Coughing and shortness of breath decrease.




1 to 2 years after quitting

Your risk of heart attack drops dramatically.




5-10 years after quitting

Your risk of cancers of the mouth, throat and voice box (larynx) is cut in half. Your risk of stroke decreases.




10 years after quitting

Your risk of lung cancer is about half that of a person who is still smoking. Your risk of cancer of the bladder, esophagus, and kidney decreases.




15 years after quitting

Your risk of coronary heart disease is close to that of a nonsmoker.




20 years after quitting

Your risk of several cancers, including those of the mouth, throat, voice box (larynx), and pancreas, drops to close to that of someone who does not smoke. Your added risk of cervical cancer drops by about half.







These are just a few of the health benefits of quitting smoking, but there are others, too.
Quitting smoking lowers your risk of other cancers over time, including cancers of the stomach, liver, cervix, colon, and rectum as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Quitting also lowers your risk of heart and lung problems such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung infections, and circulation around your heart and other body parts.
People who quit smoking can also add as much as 10 years to their life, compared to people who continue to smoke.
Quitting while you're younger can reduce your health risks more (for example, quitting before the age of 40 reduces the risk of dying from smoking-related disease by about 90%). But quitting at any age can give back years of life that would be lost by continuing to smoke.
Are there other benefits of quitting that I’ll notice right away?
Kicking the tobacco habit offers other rewards that you’ll notice right away and some that will show up over time.
Right away you’ll save the money you would have spent on tobacco. You may also notice these benefits:

Food tastes better.
Your sense of smell returns to normal.
Your breath, hair, and clothes smell better.
Your teeth and fingernails stop yellowing.
Ordinary activities (like climbing stairs or light housework) leave you less out of breath.
You can be in smoke-free buildings without having to go outside to smoke.














Guide to Quitting Tobacco 


Tobacco addiction is both mental and physical. For most people, the best way to quit is some combination of medicine, a method to change personal habits, and emotional support.



 












Staying Tobacco-free After You Quit 


Deciding to quit tobacco is a major milestone. But staying quit is the final, longest, and most important part of the process.
